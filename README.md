# Machine Learning - Bank Marketing Campaign
Data analysis and ML models for Bank Marketing Campaign - Classification

#### Data set information: 

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

This dataset is public available for research. The details are described in [Moro et al., 2014].

#### Created ML models:
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbours
3. Support Vector Machine
4. Kernel SVM
5. Naive Bayes
6. Decision Tree Classification
7. Random Forest Classification
8. XGBoost
9. Artificial Neural Networks

#### Experiments:
- Balanced data set
- Smaller data set (with 10% of the examples - randomly selected)

#### Conclusions:
- During analysis, assumptions and insights from the original version are confirmed in both smaller and balanced data set. Moreover, the differences are clearer.
- Best performances: Kernel SVM, XGBoost, Artifical Nerural Network.
