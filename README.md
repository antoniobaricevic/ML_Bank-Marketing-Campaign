# Machine Learning - Bank Marketing Campaign
Data analysis and ML models for Bank Marketing Campaign

#### Data set information: 

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

This dataset is public available for research. The details are described in [Moro et al., 2014].
